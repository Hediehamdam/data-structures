# Data Structures and Algorithms in Python

This repository contains implementations of fundamental data structures
and algorithm exercises in Python. The goal is to practice core
computer science concepts and learn how to organize code clearly.


## Contents

### Data Structures
- **Stack** (`stack.py`): LIFO structure for undo/redo operations.
- **Queue** (`queue.py`): FIFO structure for task scheduling.
- **Circular Queue** (`circular_queue.py`): Memory-efficient queue.
- **Singly Linked List** (`singly_linked_list.py`): Dynamic list.
- **Doubly Linked List** (`doubly_linked_list.py`): Two-way list.
- **Binary Tree** (`binary_tree.py`): Hierarchical data representation.
- **Max Heap** (`max_heap.py`): Priority queue implementation.

### Algorithms
- **Sudoku Solver** (`sudoku_solver.py`): Backtracking solution for Sudoku.
- **N-Queens** (`n_queens.py`): Place 8 queens on 8x8 board safely.
- **Number of Islands** (`number_of_islands.py`): DFS solution on 2D matrix.
- **DFS on Binary Tree** (`dfs_binary_tree.py`): Tree traversal using DFS.

## How to Run
Navigate to the desired directory and run the Python file:

```bash
python data_structures/stack.py
python algorithms/sudoku_solver.py
